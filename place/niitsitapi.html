        <p> "[A] 'virgin site' on the coulee," eh? All this talk of the university being the inaugural entity on the
            west side isn't quite accurate, is it? We can’t act like this place is a blank slate, a fresh and untouched
            world. There was life here long before the university, before Lethbridge... hell, it was here before
            Sikoohkotoki, before humanity, too. Just something to think about.</p>

        <p class="tangent">(Anthropocentrism ain't cute, babe.)</p>

        <p>Again with the digressions. Let's turn back to the topic at hand, because I have instructions for you:</p>

        <!-- INDIGENOUS NAMES. You build an institution on native land, then you name your residence buildings after the peoples who once lived
        here, and you mispronounce their names. That creates quite the unfortunate analogy, doesn’t it? -->

        <!-- Some buildings on campus have adopted signage in Niitsi'powahsin (Blackfoot language). How many people on campus
        can understand these words? There have to be further efforts to support learning, or else the signs just
        showcase a language in limbo, like a mummy on display in a museum. Visible yet dead. -->


        <!-- LIBRARY.

        It's not nonsense. -->

        <h2 class="center-container"> Stamssaakiitsi'poyit.</h2>
        <!-- Just try to speak Blackfoot -->


        <p>Do you know what I mean? Can I blame you if you don’t? It's not nonsense; you just don't possess the
            right vocabulary. Maybe you should look for somebody/something to help.</p>
