            <p>"...Geoff Massey wrote to the university president, W.A.S. (Sam) Smith...to report that the west
                Lethbridge coulee, in Erickson and Massey's opinion, was superior in almost every aspect to the existing
                college location. Geoff's argument stressed the importance of "seizing upon a site which is a challenge
                to the imagination of all concerned" (Stouck, 2013, p. 235).

                    the Lethbridge area</a>. Although the
                circumstances of the flight still remain obscure, there was suspicion that the long-simmering question
                of univerity site lurked in the minds of the sponsors. At any rate, the story goes that while the
                airplane was crossing the valley from east to west, Erickson was asked for his opinion on a proper site
                for the University of Lethbridge. Nonchalantly he offered "there," pointing vaguely downward, so that a
                reporter, who by a remarkable coincidence just happened to be sitting beside Erickson, was able to
                flaunt a headline next day proclaiming that the noted architect had plumped for a campus in the coulees.

        Under the banner "A Surprised, Grateful Lethbridge", the Herald proclaimed "Lethbridge has seldom been more
        elated and excited than over the announcement Friday that a university would definitely be established here",
        and added "a grateful Lethbridge says a congratulatory thank you".

        The Lethbridge Herald directed a constant barrage of artillery fire against the government. In a blistering
        editorial titled "Hang Down Your Head", the newspaper impugned Reierson's motivation, charging him with "a
        reluctance to make a decision unpopular with certain pressure groups".

        STUFF ABOUT DISCONTENT WITHIN THE UNI
        <p>THE COLLAPSE The faculty of the university section suffered sore affliction during the fall of 1966. The
            unanimity of purpose and enthusiasm of spirit that marked early September gradually soured to
            disillusionment and bitterness toward both board and government, and eventually to a virulent internal
            malaise that literally consumed the faculty itself. The absence of constitutional prerogatives and the
            failure of authorities to encourage or even accept the faculty's participation generated simultaneous
            attitudes of incapacitating insecurity and destructive defiance. 46</p>
        <p>“Stung to the quick by the critical outburst consequent to their appointment, naked of jurisdictional
            authority until formal assumption of office at the first of the new year, and befuddled by the host of
            uncertainties still beclouding the institutional transition, the group of seven inherited willy-nilly the
            premature trusteeship of an unborn university.” 50</p>

        <p>“Yuletide. Twas the season to be merry — peace on earth and goodwill to all! But we were finding it just a
            bit difficult to maintain that air of holiday happiness so essential in a household of children. I had been
            wounded. Though perhaps not mortally, it definitely was time to begin disbanding the old homestead and
            seeking appointment elsewhere. Somehow Lethbridge had lost its lustre that night the headlines emblazoned my
            dismissal as dean. In retrospect, I had not anticipated at all the tragic collapse of the faculty of the
            university section. Incorrectly I had assumed that there was general awareness of the potential hazards of
            the public stance adopted in August through the issuance of the statement that had short-circuited the
            alleged authority of the college board. But those of us with relevant experience had been falsely encouraged
            by the apparent unanimity of spirit and what had seemed at the time to be a resolute determination to stand
            by the guns through thick and thin. And we had suspected that it might become thick indeed. Recognizing my
            own dangerously exposed position as dean of the university section, administratively responsible to the
            board but spiritually aligned with the faculty, during what threatened to escalate into a bitter struggle, I
            offered my resignation from the administrative post on August 4, just three days after assumption of office,
            explicitly declaring my fundamental disagreement with the board's policy for university development. My
            offer was rejected, perhaps because it would have appeared absurd politically to terminate an appointment
            just so recently consummated with much fanfare. It was a shock to witness the number of trench mates
            decreasing daily when the live ammunition began to fly in October and November. I for one had misinterpreted
            the motivations and misjudged the intentions of those who became early casualties. The insecurities
            engendered by the persistent unknowns in the university equation took their toll, especially when it seemed
            that the future of the university would be determined by the obdurate college authorities, with potentially
            ominous consequences for the professional welfare of those instructors who had crossed the board's purposes.

        <p>misunderstood, mistrusted and resented the academic perspective. Her lengthy career in the institutions of
            public education had not exposed her to or prepared her for the true nature of the academy. Her infrequent
            encounters with such eminences as university presidents and deans, which she proudly valued as direct
            contacts with the universities, were at best misleading. By design such persons reflect only the bland
            exterior, not the intellectual ferment seething within. I was at a loss to understand what motivations Kate
            Andrews attributed to her tormentors during the struggle over institutional form. For lack of better
            insight, I surmised that she interpreted the straightforward theme of the faculty statement of August as
            some sort of devious grasp for exclusive power. During my career at Lethbridge, at no time was I in basic
            disagreement with Kate Andrews regarding the operation of the Lethbridge Junior College, and at no time in
            accord with her regarding plans for university development. I regretted sincerely that our initial mutual
            respect during the period of my acting principalship deteriorated progressively to such a point that she 57”
