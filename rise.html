<!-- WIS pg 42 rejecting "burn" mentality
Mr. James Foster minister of advanced education -->



<p>There is a quote which was originally by Dr. Arnold of Rugby, then repeated in a BBC TV lecture, and finally picked
    up by Jeanne Beaty while writing for the Lethbridge Herald: "No one ought to meddle with universities who does not
    know them and love them well" (p. 25).</p>
<p>People have had to scrap for recognition, to fight for this institution to exist. The inaugural years of this
    university encompassed a pivotal era wherein everyone was giddy. Their worries were lapped over by the idea that, if
    nothing else, this would be a hell of a ride. There were lots of ideas swapping heads, pens scrawling on papers.
    "How might we do this?" "What could be possible?" "How will this bring light to the world?"</p>
<p>My Latin is dusty, but from what I recall, “fiat lux” can be translated in two different ways. One is “let there be
    light,” but the other is “let light be made.”</p>
<p>The light will not be here for us, inherently. It does not rise like the sun. It does not beam to us from the stars.
    It is generated kinetically, intellectually, emotionally, and there is no way to store it. It dissipates at the
    speed of, well, light. We must always be making more of it.</p>
