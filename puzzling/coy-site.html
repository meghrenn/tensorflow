        <!-- Stay and stare 'til something's there</p>
        <p>The secret stairs! I should have known. There are lots of "sites" on campus that I consider quite "coy,"
            <a id="egg">playfully hiding away,</a> none are so infamous as this. It's been the
            crime scene for myriad acts of debauchery and excess--whatever evil force this is, its presence there must
            be extra powerful.
        </p>
        <p>That has to be why it's calling you there. Steel yourself for whatever you may find.</p> -->

        <!-- <p class="eldritch-speak">(Pastel ate owe fore.)</p>
        <p>How do we choose which one to seek out? I've have to meditate on this. In the meantime, I have something for
            you to work on:</p> -->

        </div>
        <p>I've been dreaming of an object. Something innovative. But you know how dreams are--they're so quick to fade
            away. I need you to stabilize it, hold it steady, make it real, somehow. Can you do this for me?</p> -->

        <p>I keep having visions of the same clue. I look down and find my hand
            has been idly tracing the letters on the tableop: <a class="clue-text">Pastel ate owe fore</a>. I'm filling
            my notebooks with it.</p>
        <p class="eldritch-speak">(Pastel ate owe fore.)</p>
        <p>I've been staring at the words for too long. <a class="clue-text">Repeat</a>ing <a class="clue-text">them
                until they don't sound like themselves.</a> Maybe you
            can make sense of them.</p>
