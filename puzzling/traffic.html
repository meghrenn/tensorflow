"Although the plethora of daily correspondence ordinarily did not permit time out for lunch, one day a splitting
headache drove me home for a brief period of rest. Almost immediately the phone rang with the alarming message that
traffic was driving through the building. Hurrying onto the campus, I discovered that the case had been overstated, but
only slightly. A group of the more enterprising students, in cahoots with an instructor, had engaged in a bit of March
madness by managing ingeniously to drive his small red convertible through the wide front doors and then back and forth
the length of the hall with unmitigated abandon, as evidenced by the skid marks on the linoleum. Forced by my role to
attempt a blustery reproof, I wasn't very convincing. At any rate the prank, which soon passed into college lore,
probably was an important factor in the improved student morale during the succeeding weeks" (Holmes, p. 31).



Then there was the candy bar caper. A wily local merchant had managed to station two candy bar vending machines in the
cafeteria. One served its owner extraordinarily well, avidly sucking in dimes, but only rarely ejecting bars. Even the
standard human reaction to such intransigence, a solid whack, did not alter the attitude of that infernal machine.
Exasperated beyond redemption one day, a student took his revenge with such percussion that the machine opened its guts
and spewed dimes and candy bars indiscriminately in all directions. Rumors concerning this event naturally reached even
the principal's office, but I prayed that they would subside if I remained in seclusion for awhile. However it was not
to be. The agitated merchant was soon loudly pounding on my door in a demand for retribution. He and I did not hit it
off very well. He threatened to call in the police, whereupon I told him to go ahead but to take his mechanical bandits
when he left the campus. Whereupon he quieted a bit, but continued to insist that I obtain his compensation. So I had no
alternative but to investigate. I found the president of the students' union to be unexpectedly co-operative, perhaps
because, as I discovered later, he had intercepted one of the airborne candy bars and consumed it forthwith. In fact
none of the bars was recoverable, at least in original form. However eventually peer-group pressure caused two students
to deposit a sum of money in my office alleged to represent the missing dimes. With much grumbling, the purveyor of
confections agreed to the cash settlement in return for his removal of his eviscerated appliance. The story had a happy
ending. At the next meeting of the committee on student affairs, the students' union undertook full responsibility for
all vending machines! Board meetings were always cloaked in an aura of uncertainty, but one was particularly notable for
its bizarre conclusion. Although every meeting was scheduled for a Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., the main course was never
served until much later, after coffee. Preparations for meetings were slipshod, and the predistributed agenda seldom
resembled the order or even the scope of the business transacted. Mrs. Andrews dominated the meetings from her chair at
the wide end of the table. From there the table pointed like the head of a spear toward the heart of the principal who
sat opposite. This arrangement was useful both in focussing the attention of all present when the principal was speaking
and in unequivocally assigning blame in times of adversity. I came to suspect that Kate rested during the day in
preparation for the evening's events. From 7:30 to about 10:00 she entertained with amusing anecdotes and pleasant
reminiscences, and sometimes rather disconcertingly with accounts of her recent private audiences and telephone calls
with the minister of education or some other equally remote and impressive potentate. During this period, some of the
routine chaff of the meeting was blown away. After coffee was over, usually around 10:30, business commenced in earnest.
If excitement was anticipated, the reporters and other visitors were evicted at this point. Although everyone but Kate
had by now become virtually exhausted from the day's activities, sometimes the meetings ran on until long after
midnight. On the particular night in mind, the meeting was on the verge of adjournment at a relatively early hour when
the chairman as usual asked if there was any other business. After a moment of silence, a throat could be heard clearing
as Member X prepared to announce that there was something else, something quite important, he wished to raise for the
attention of the board. He observed that since this was the college's building, the board should have full control over
what was displayed on the walls. This unexpected outburst prompted an immediate demand for amplification. Member X
thereupon announced that earlier on that very day an obscene poster 32had been observed on a wall in that very college
building. Amid the rising eyebrows, and with just the trace of a smile on her face, Kate asked for the poster's message.
The aggrieved Member X refused to say, but after general encouragement, allowed that he would write it down for the
board's inspection. A piece of paper was found, and the inscription commenced. The mysterious message then passed slowly
from hand to hand around the table, the pregnant silence broken only by a succession of horrified gasps. By the time it
reached my trembling fingers, I feared the very worst. I cast my terrified eyes upon Fuck For Peace! After inspired
rhetoric from all around the table, I was instructed in no uncertain terms to seek and destroy. Then, mercifully, the
meeting adjourned. I later learned that while packing his books, a departing instructor had discovered the long lost
poster acquired somewhere in his travels, and had set it upright upon the empty bookshelf. Normally nothing would have
come of this, except that through the doorway his bookshelf was visible down a lengthy hall, and the offensive
exhortation had been displayed during the noon hour of the day that the Kiwanis Club had organized a special luncheon on
campus.33
