            <p> "In his development plan, Arthur had written: "Buildings must grow out of the ground, clustered with
                other buildings or trees, but never sit blatantly on top of the ground. Forms must be simple and
                geometrically concise, as elaborate forms and fussy details show weakness... Just as the prairie
                landscape has been reduced to essentials, so must its buildings be elemental, of the earth" (Stouck,

                "[I]t is questionable whether the coulee areas will endure the high intensity use
                generated by the concentrated academic and living areas. Under the pressure of university life, students
                predictably react vigorously during their moments of outdoor leisure. The use of artificial restraints
                cannot fully protect against such abuse and very possibly these restraints could lead to rebelliously
                intentional misuse. Today's students often react with hostility towards restrictions that appear to them
                arbitrary and artificial.

                such considerations cannot be passed off as merely disciplinary problems" ("Landscape Analysis...",
