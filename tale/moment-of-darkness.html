        <p> Surprise steals my breath like a chinook. </p>
        <p>I look at us and wonder, Are we worth saving?</p>
        <p class="tangent">(I think we’ve become just like the rest of them.)
        </p>
        <p>We let there be light, but it’s just a dull fluorescent beam. The eyes ache to look at it. I keep asking
            myself, Do we care for each other? Are we a community? </p>
        <p class="tangent">(I feel a little sick.)</p>
        <p>Our institution's first president, W.A.S. Smith, once said: "I suppose that because I've been treated
            well by it, I want there to be a reason for the university's continued existence" (p.15).
            I've been searching for that reason. I've been struggling to explain myself. I don't know. I don't know.</p>
