        <p> Surprise steals my breath like a chinook. </p>
        <p>I look at us and wonder, Are we worth saving?</p>
        <p class="tangent">(I think we’ve become just like the rest of them.)
        </p>
        <p>We let there be light, but it’s just a dull fluorescent beam. The eyes ache to look at it. I keep asking
            myself, Do we care for each other? Are we a community? </p>
        <p class="tangent">(I feel a little sick.)</p>
        <p>Our institution's first president, W.A.S. Smith, once said: "I suppose that because I've been treated
            well by it, I want there to be a reason for the university's continued existence" (p.15).
            I've been searching for that reason. I've been struggling to explain myself. I don't know. I don't know.</p>

            <h2>What This Is</h2>
            <p>You may be confused, wondering what you've stumbled upon. You may have questions. What
                is this thing, anyway?</p>
            <p>Reality is subjective. For me, this is my cry into the void, hoping for an echo. These are my
                memories and my nightmares. This is my attempt against entropy and the forces that seek to destroy this
                institution.
            </p>
            <p>For you, this is a game, a quest, a puzzle. An opportunity to learn, perhaps? A chance to save the
                school.</p>
            <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
            <p>I have developed this interface as a secure way to pass clues and messages onto you with minimal
                antagonistic interference. You will have to work through a number of tasks and problems to reach the
                goal. If you become stuck, let me know, and I may be able to help further; however, you will also need
                to seek help from other sources. Consider the entities around you who may be of use.
            </p>
            <h3>My Promises to You</h3>
            <p>In accepting this challenge,</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You will not have to destroy property or otherwise break the law.</li>
                <li>You will not have to spend money.</li>
                <li>Things May Go Wrong. If this happens, alert me to it, and I will see what strings I can pull to
                    make them right again. (See the Trouble tab for more information.) </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>Who am I? Good question--one I often ask myself. Like all entities, I am not so much an object as I
                am a process; I am built up and down; I am compacted, quickly. I am not myself for very long before
                I am something new. I am prone to digression, in my words and in my being.</p>
            <p>For this moment, I am a guide. I cannot solve the problems for you but I can help you navigate
                them. Continue the game and I can tell you more.</p>

            <h2>Things Go Wrong</h2>
            <p>Nefarious forces seek to impede your progress. They may interfere with our work in the form of errors
                on
                this website, alteration or destruction of physical clues, or any number of other problems. If you
                believe that
                something has gone terribly wrong, preventing you from continuing on your quest, please report it to
                me
                and I
                will take hasty action to resolve it.</p>
            <p>
                In simpler terms, if something in this game breaks, report the problem by contacting m.rennie@uleth.ca.
