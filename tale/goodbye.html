“Students frequently reach tentative decisions about university attendance during the spring of their last school year.
It was essential that Lethbridge be known as an available option. The demand for information reached such a crescendo
that, despite the unavailability of details of the semesterized curriculum until June, it was decided to issue a
preliminary calendar in March. This first edition of the 1967-68 calendar described adequately the scope of the programs
of both faculties and indicated subject areas and courses of instruction in terms of the Calgary numbers utilized by the
college. Although it announced the adoption of the semester system and hinted at some of the anticipated academic
innovations, the first edition projected a rather staid image. However it was a useful resource for several forays into
the neighboring schools under the general organization and direction of L. G. Hoye in his capacity as assistant for
publicity services. the students registered in the university section, prime candidates for admission to the new
university, required more than just the basic information in the calendar. They sought assurances of the transferability
to other universities of credit for the proposed semesterized courses and of the acceptability of Lethbridge degrees by
employers and other institutions. In a series of informal sessions organized by Dean Holmes, university officials
attempted to answer their queries. While the students could be guaranteed that college credits acceptable within the
terms of affiliation with the University of Calgary would be fully recognized at the University of Lethbridge, there
could be no assurance that the latter's courses would be accepted elsewhere. No university could make such a claim. And
only time would reveal how Lethbridge degrees would be assessed externally. The result of a questionnaire distributed in
February was not encouraging. The majority of eligible second-year students indicated that they either would not attend
Lethbridge or were undecided. This disheartening early response must be attributed to the abundant uncertainties
enshrouding the new university, because in the end almost all did enroll for the fall semester. Superintendents,
principals and teachers also sought assurances of the quality of the university's program and in particular of the
validity of the radical admission policy. Their concerns were not allayed by critical spokesmen from the other
provincial universities. Lethbridge officials could only reiterate expressions of confidence and prepare to stand or
fall on performance. One way or another, the university established many other valuable contacts during this early
phase, some at its own instigation, some on the initiative of other entities. The City of Lethbridge formally welcomed
President Leskiw, the chamber of commerce hosted the faculty and board, the research station of the Canada Department of
Agriculture invited members of the faculty to tour its facilities and to meet its professional staff, and business firms
joined in welcoming new arrivals. For its part, the university applied for membership in the Association of Universities
and Colleges of Canada, welcomed an exploratory visit from the arts officer of the Canada Council, and informally
approached the National Research Council regarding the eligibility of faculty for research grants. In an effort of
heroic proportions, B. M. Bilgin of the university section earned much good will for both college and university by
almost single-handedly organizing and staging an international week featuring costumes, handicraft, art, literature,
films and displays of many nations, and climaxed by a folk festival highlighted by native dances of twelve ethnic groups
represented among the population of southern Alberta. Press, radio and television in Lethbridge and the surrounding
district afforded ample opportunity for R. M. Goodall, director of information services, to publicize the university
through a constant barrage of news releases and articles not only purveying the facts about the university, but also the
associated flights of fancy. The abundant friendship displayed by others during the induction phase raised the spirits
of all those involved with the project. Perhaps it lulled them into a false sense of security that would soon enough be
rudely shattered. 82” 82

“For admission to the University of Lethbridge, the beginning student would require a high school diploma plus
matriculation standing in English and four other subjects from Biology, Chemistry, French, German, Latin, Mathematics,
Physics, Social Studies, Ukrainian and, with some limitations, Music. For an applicant from a jurisdiction other than
Alberta, admission was to be determined by the equivalence of the candidate's credentials as established by an
admissions committee. Mature persons lacking formal credentials could seek admission through a special review involving
the counselling service and the admissions committee. During the first few years of its application, this last procedure
proved effective in attracting many residents of the Lethbridge area who previously had been denied the opportunity to
profit directly from the provincial investment in university facilities.” 70

                The muted light of morning spills down the coulees . A beige 1967 Chrysler New Yorker pulls into the
                parking lot; the necessities of life are stacked puzzle-perfect in the back. In the driver’s seat is a
                father, a man with
                thick-framed glasses and shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Sitting shotgun is a gangly young
                doppelganger—his son. </p>
            <p>The men get out of the car and follow the signs directing them to the housing office. There’s already a
                line of other first-years and their families, waiting to sort out their paperwork and pick up the keys
                to their dorms. Standing in line, the son shifts his weight from foot to foot. The father puts his
                hands on his hips and waits for something to fail his expectations. He glances at a bulletin board
                showcasing various amenities available to residents. A big sign in the centre of it reads Welcome to the
                University of Lethbridge. </p>
            <p> The University of Lethbridge, an institution too young to have a legacy. There are no children of alumni
                here; there won’t be for a number of years. Everyone’s fledgling, spunky with something to
                prove—wanting to start fires, working to hold their lights aloft. What else is there to do in this life,
                other than brandish a torch against the doom that forever seems to sweep the world? Heck, The October
                Crisis was just under a year ago. A national security threat which left the father seriously fearing for
                Canadians' freedoms. People thought the editor of the student paper would be <a

            <p>Suffice it to say, the University of Lethbridge is not the father’s alma matter. It wouldn’t have been
                his choice of institution, either. It’s not that he doesn’t trust his son's decision or doesn’t think
                the
                boy is capable. Rather, the father remembers his own mistakes. He wants more than anything to protect
                his son from everything: failure, disappointment, regret.
                <a href="moment-of-darkness.html" target="_blank">There are so many things that one can do
                    wrong.</a>
            </p>
            <p>They get the son’s key and head to his dorm. He’s supposed to have a roommate but the other young man
                hasn’t shown up yet. This makes things easier because it’s only the son moving in, at the moment. It
                makes things harder because it leaves the two men alone together. </p>
            <p>Of course it’s awkward. This is goodbye but they still have to be around each other, and neither knows
                how to act or what to say. Not that much gets said between them most of the time. Fathers tend to love
                through telekinesis.</p>
            <p>The men replace words with work. Boxes are moved, some belongings unpacked: bedsheets, an alarm clock,
                and a typewriter. A small collection of pulp sci-fi paperbacks. A sappy note from Mom that she must have
                snuck into a box last-minute, which makes the son blush and squirrel it away in a desk drawer. That’s
                about it. The rest of the work, he’ll handle alone.</p>
            <p>So they stand in the doorway, the son in the dorm and the father out in the hall, facing one another with
                some distance between them. Magnets oriented the wrong way. From this point on, the distance is only
                going to widen: the father will leave the building, get back in his car, and drive home; the son will
                distract himself with the process of moving in and the novelties of semi-independent living. They will
                try to call each other, now and then, but they will not know what to say besides small talk. It had
                always been enough just to spend time together, to share activities. Once this common thread is cut,
                they won’t know how to be around each other anymore.</p>
            <p>The father breaches the threshold and wraps his son in his arms. The son, surprised, takes a moment
                before hugging back. It’s awkward and uncomfortable—not so much an embrace as a mutual squeeze, tensing
                muscles like it’s exercise. But it’s a good hug. Yeah. A good hug.</p>
            <p>After a moment, they both let go and step back. Hands are relegated to pockets; sentiments are
                sequestered for the sake of decorum. “See you, dad,” the son says, one hand moving to loosely grasp the
                doorknob.</p>
            <p>The father nods his head, sorrow and pride at an impasse on his smile. He knows that <a
                    class="clue-text">say</a>ing <a class="clue-text">it out loud</a> will make it real.</p>
            <p><a class="clue-text"> “Bye, son.”</a></p>
