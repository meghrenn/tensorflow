        <h2>What This Is</h2>
        <p>You may be confused, wondering what you've stumbled upon. You may have questions. What
            is this thing, anyway?</p>
        <p>Reality is subjective. For me, this is my cry into the void, hoping for an echo. These are my
            memories and my nightmares. This is my attempt against entropy and the forces that seek to destroy this
            institution.
        </p>
        <p>For you, this is a game, a quest, a puzzle. An opportunity to learn, perhaps? A chance to save the
            school.</p>
        <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
        <p>I have developed this interface as a secure way to pass clues and messages onto you with minimal
            antagonistic interference. You will have to work through a number of tasks and problems to reach the
            goal. If you become stuck, let me know, and I may be able to help further; however, you will also need
            to seek help from other sources. Consider the entities around you who may be of use.
        </p>
        <h3>My Promises to You</h3>
        <p>In accepting this challenge,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You will not have to destroy property or otherwise break the law.</li>
            <li>You will not have to spend money.</li>
            <li>Things May Go Wrong. If this happens, alert me to it, and I will see what strings I can pull to
                make them right again. (See the Trouble tab for more information.) </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>Who am I? Good question--one I often ask myself. Like all entities, I am not so much an object as I
            am a process; I am built up and down; I am compacted, quickly. I am not myself for very long before
            I am something new. I am prone to digression, in my words and in my being.</p>
        <p>For this moment, I am a guide. I cannot solve the problems for you but I can help you navigate
            them. Continue the game and I can tell you more.</p>

        <h2>Things Go Wrong</h2>
        <p>Nefarious forces seek to impede your progress. They may interfere with our work in the form of errors
            on
            this website, alteration or destruction of physical clues, or any number of other problems. If you
            believe that
            something has gone terribly wrong, preventing you from continuing on your quest, please report it to
            me
            and I
            will take hasty action to resolve it.</p>
        <p>
            In simpler terms, if something in this game breaks, report the problem by contacting m.rennie@uleth.ca.
